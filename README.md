# EDA
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if an applicant has difficulty in paying his/her installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected and the number of defaulters is also reduced.

We have used simple EDA techniques to find out the most significant features driving the default cases.
